# Kush Eats - Server

**Author**: Max Suman, Stephen Harper, Khalil Ahmed, Tim McCoy
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Accessing Yelp and Google Maps API's to dynamically pull information for Seattle marijuana dispenaries and nearby fast food restaurants near these locations. We are building it because we saw there is a need for both to populate on the map.


## Getting Started
To be able to build this app, the developer should have a computer. And have access to Google and Yelp API's. VS Code or Atom. Heroku for deployment.

## Architecture
The technologies we used are multiple. For languages, we used Javascript, CSS and HTML. For libraries, we used jQuery, page.js, express.js, yelp.fusion (Yelp API), Google Maps API, Cors, PostgreSQL. And we deployed our site on Heroku.

## Change Log

04-30-2018 - Decided on utilizing Google Maps API. Got map to show on the page.
05-01-2018 - Decided to utilize the Yelp API at the end of the day because we want information to dynamically show up on the Maps API. Google Places API was considered but we felt Yelp had better documentation.
05-02-2018 - Got Yelp API information for both the marijuana dispenaries and fast food restaurants to show up on map dynamically for the local Seattle area. Achieved MVP with backend completed locally.
05-03-2018 - Deployed to Heroku site. Fixed bugs and successfully deployed. Full MVP completed.
05-04-2018 - Added in README for server side.
